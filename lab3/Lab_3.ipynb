    "Note that an addition or subtraction operation has negligible cost in\n",
    "relation to a multiplication or division operation. So the subtraction\n",
    "in this case can be treated as one with the multiplication operation.\n",
    "The first pivot is selected from the first row in the matrix. For each\n",
    "of the remaining rows, one div and $(n-1)$ mult/sub operations are used\n",
