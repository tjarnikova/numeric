    "Taylor Series are of fundamental importance in numerical analysis. They\n",
    "are the most basic tool for talking about the approximation of\n",
    "functions. Consider a function $f(x)$ that is smooth – when we say\n",
    "“smooth”, what we mean is that its derivatives exist and are bounded\n",
    "(for the following discussion, we need $f$ to have $(n+1)$ derivatives).\n",
    "We would like to approximate $f(x)$ near the point $x=x_0$, and we can\n",
    "do it as follows:\n",
    "$$f(x) = \\underbrace{P_n(x)}_{\\mbox{Taylor polynomial}} +\n",
    "  \\underbrace{R_n(x)}_{\\mbox{remainder term}},$$ where\n",
    "$$P_n(x)=f(x_0)+ f^\\prime(x_0)(x-x_0) +\n",
    "  \\frac{f^{\\prime\\prime}(x_0)}{2!}(x-x_0)^2 + \\cdots + \n",
    "  \\frac{f^{(n)}(x_0)}{n!}(x-x_0)^n$$ is the *$n$th order Taylor\n",
    "polynomial* of $f$ about $x_0$, and\n",
    "$$R_n(x)=\\frac{f^{(n+1)}(\\xi(x))}{(n+1)!}(x-x_0)^{n+1}$$ is the\n",
    "*remainder term* or *truncation error*. The point $\\xi(x)$ in the error\n",
    "term lies somewhere between the points $x_0$ and $x$. If we look at the\n",
    "infinite sum ( let $n\\rightarrow\\infty$), then the resulting infinite\n",
    "sum is called the *Taylor series of $f(x)$ about $x=x_0$*. This result\n",
    "is also know as *Taylor’s Theorem*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that we assumed that $f(x)$ is smooth (in particular, that its\n",
    "derivatives up to order $(n+1)$ exist and are finite). That means that\n",
    "all of the derivatives appearing in $P_n$ and $R_n$ are bounded.\n",
    "Therefore, there are two ways in which we can think of the Taylor\n",
    "polynomial $P_n(x)$ as an approximation of $f(x)$:"

    "1.  First of all, let us fix $n$. Then, we can improve the approximation\n",
    "    by letting $x$ approach $x_0$, since as $(x-x_0)$ gets small, the\n",
    "    error term $R_n(x)$ goes to zero ($n$ is considered fixed and all\n",
    "    terms depending on $n$ are thus constant). Therefore, the\n",
    "    approximation improves when $x$ gets closer and closer to $x_0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Alternatively, we can think of fixing $x$. Then, we can improve the\n",
    "    approximation by taking more and more terms in the series. When $n$\n",
    "    is increased, the factorial in the denominator of the error term\n",
    "    will eventually dominate the $(x-x_0)^{n+1}$ term (regardless of how\n",
    "    big $(x-x_0)$ is), and thus drive the error to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, we have two ways of improving the Taylor polynomial\n",
    "approximation to a function: by evaluating it at points closer to the\n",
    "point $x_0$; and by taking more terms in the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "This property of the Taylor expansion can be seen by a simple example.\n",
    "Consider the Taylor polynomial for the function $f(x)=\\sin(x)$ about the\n",
    "point $x_0=0$. All of the even terms are zero, so that if we take $n$\n",
    "odd ( $n=2k+1$), then the $n$th order Taylor polynomial is\n",
    "$$P_{2k+1}(x)=x+\\frac{x^3}{3!}+\\frac{x^5}{5!}+\\frac{x^7}{7!}+\\cdots\n",
    "    +\\frac{x^{2k+1}}{(2k+1)!}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The plot in Figure Taylor-series  illustrates quite clearly\n",
    "how the approximation improves both as $x$ approaches 0, and as $n$ is\n",

    "## A.2 Floating Point Representation of Numbers <a name=\"floating-point\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike a mathematician, who can deal with real numbers having infinite\n",
    "precision, a computer can represent numbers with only a finite number of\n",
    "digits. The best way to understand how a computer stores a number is to\n",
    "look at its *floating-point form*, in which a number is written as\n",
    "$$\\pm 0.d_1 d_2 d_3 \\ldots d_k \\times 10^n,$$ where each digit, $d_i$ is\n",
    "between 0 and 9 (except $d_1$, which must be non-zero). Floating point\n",
    "form is commonly used in the physical sciences to represent numerical\n",
    "values; for example, the Earth’s radius is approximately 6,400,000\n",
    "metres, which is more conveniently written in floating point form as\n",
    "$0.64\\times 10^7$ (compare this to the general form above).\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers actually store numbers in *binary form* (i.e. in base-2\n",
    "floating point form, as compared to the decimal or base-10 form shown\n",
    "above). However, it is more convenient to use the decimal form in order\n",
    "to illustrate the basic idea of computer arithmetic. For a good\n",
    "discussion of the binary representation of numbers, see Burden & Faires\n",
    " @burden-faires [sec. 1.2].\n",
    "\n",
    "For the remainder of this discussion, assume that we’re dealing with a\n",
    "computer that can store numbers with up to 8 *significant digits*\n",
    "(i.e. $k=8$) and exponents in the range $-38 \\leq n \\leq 38$. Based on\n",
    "these values, we can make a few observations regarding the numbers that\n",
    "can be represented:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The largest number that can be represented is about $1.0\\times\n",
    "      10^{+38}$, while the smallest is $1.0\\times 10^-38$.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   These numbers have a lot of *holes*, where real numbers are missed.\n",
    "    For example, consider the two consecutive floating point numbers\n",
    "    $$0.13391482 \\times 10^5 \\;\\;\\; {\\rm and} \\;\\;\\; 0.13391483 \\times 10^5,$$\n",
    "    or 13391.482 and 13391.483. Our floating-point number system cannot\n",
    "    represent any numbers between these two values, and hence any number\n",
    "    in between 13391.482 and 13391.483 must be approximated by one of\n",
    "    the two values. Another way of thinking of this is to observe that\n",
    "    $0.13391482 \\times 10^5$ does not represent just a single real\n",
    "    number, but a whole *range* of numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Notice that the same amount of floating-point numbers can be\n",
    "    represented between $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-5}$ as are between $10^{20}$\n",
    "    and $10^{21}$. Consequently, the density of floating points numbers\n",
    "    increases as their magnitude becomes smaller. That is, there are\n",
    "    more floating-point numbers close to zero than there are far away.\n",
    "    This is illustrated in the Figure [lab2:fig:float].\n",
    "\n",
    "    The floating-point numbers (each represented by a $\\times$) are\n",
    "    more dense near the origin.\n",

    "The values $k=8$ and $-38\\leq n \\leq 38$ correspond to what is known as\n",
